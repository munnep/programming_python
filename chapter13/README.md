# Chapter 13: Searching and sorting

lineair search
```
>>> ['d', 'a', 'b', 'a'].index('a')
1
```

Binary search

you will need an ordered list for this
```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
```
you keep deviding the list in half and check if the value is larger then in your lost. If not you devide it until you get to the value. 


see the different examples how you can sort things
